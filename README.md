## SQL Practice Project â€“ Employees Database

## Overview

This project is a collection of ten SQL exercises solved using the classic **Employees** database. It was completed as part of a structured learning path in SQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. The goal was to strengthen query writing skills, explore relational database concepts, and apply SQL logic to real-world scenarios.

## About the Dataset

The **Employees** database contains information about employee records, departments, salaries, titles, and employment history. The schema includes six interconnected tables:

- `employees`
- `departments`
- `dept_manager`
- `dept_emp`
- `salaries`
- `titles`

A visual representation of the schema is included in this repository for reference.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL Platform:** MySQL
- **Script Format:** All queries are written in a single `.sql` file for simplicity and ease of review.
- **Tools:** No external IDEs or tools were used.

## Exercises Covered

The project includes solutions to the following tasks:

1. Calculating average salary by gender and department.
2. Identifying the lowest and highest department numbers.
3. Using subqueries and CASE statements to assign managers based on employee number.
4. Filtering employees hired in the year 2000.
5. Querying engineers and senior engineers from the titles table.
6. Creating a stored procedure to retrieve the last department worked in.
7. Counting high-value, long-duration salary contracts.
8. Building a trigger to validate hire dates.
9. Defining functions to retrieve minimum and maximum salary values.
10. Creating a flexible function to return salary extremes or their difference.

## Highlights

One of the most rewarding parts of this project was working with the `CASE` statement in Exercise 3. It opened up new ways of thinking about conditional logic in SQL and helped deepen my understanding of how to structure dynamic queries.

## Learning Source

This project was completed as part of a Udemy course on SQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. The exercises and schema were provided through the course, and all solutions are my own.
